<h2>ihorvereshch Blog Day 1: 5th July 2025.</h2>

<p>Hi to whoever sees this blog. Hope you have a great day.</p>

<p>My name is Ihor, and I work as a Salesforce Developer. I've decided to create a blog in which I'm going to create small games on plain HTML/JS.<br/>
In this blog, I'll give a general rundown starting from the concept and ending with a final game.<br/>
The game(hopefully -s) will be uploaded to this site and the source code will be downloadable.<br/>
There are multiple goals behind this project including, but not limited, to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop end-to-end project(s) on my own;</li>
<li>Learn something new and improve my coding skills;</li>
<li>Share my experience and knowledge with others;</li>
<li>Explain the process of completing programming tasks in generally relevant way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today is a hot sunny Saturday, and I've decided to finally do this idea of solo game-dev-for-fun blog.<br/>
I already have an idea for the very first game, but that will be in tomorrow's blog.<br/>
That's it for the main dish, now to an optional dessert of some thoughts on my mind.</p>

<p>Considering this blog being about small games, it'd be truly evil to hide something in this page already.<br/>
You know, some codes or links, Welcome to the Game type of stuff (but without Noir and assassins; they're too expensive).<br/>
I haven't even started my first game, and I'm already thinking ahead of time. To be fair, that's what this section is and will be about.<br/>
It also gives an additional benefit of storing the ideas, so I can come back to actually do those. Or someone else, I'm not looking to financially benefit out of these.</p>

<p>Well, that was the first entry in my blog. I'll keep it going daily. Due to a job, my weekday entries won't be as content-filled as the weekend ones.<br/>
Thanks for reading. Bye</p>
